# Architecture Overview

This document describes the overall shape of the system, the layers it is built
from, and how data flows through them. Read this first; the other documents
zoom into individual layers.

## Guiding principles

1. **No backend.** There is no application server and no database. All room
   state is computed in the browser. The only remote dependency at runtime is
   Ably (realtime relay) and a few third-party media/analytics services.
2. **State machine as the source of truth.** Room behavior is expressed once, as
   an XState machine. The UI is a pure function of machine state; networking is
   just a transport for machine events.
3. **Every client is authoritative over its own copy.** There is no elected
   leader that owns the canonical state. Instead, all clients run the same
   reducer (the machine) over the same event stream and converge.
4. **Static, pre-rendered delivery.** The app ships as static HTML/JS built by
   Bun and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## The layers

```

### 1. Delivery & routing

The build produces **two HTML documents**, each with its own React entry point:

| Document | Bootstraps | Renders | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | `src/home-bootstrap.tsx` | `App` → `Home` | The marketing landing page (`/`) |
| `404.html` | `src/session-bootstrap.tsx` | `Session` → `SessionPage` | The voting room SPA |

The clever part: on **GitHub Pages**, any path that doesn't match a real file is
served `404.html`. So visiting `https://voting.poker/<roomId>` serves the
`404.html` document, which boots the room app. The room id is simply the last
path segment (`location.href.split("/").pop()`, see
`src/Session/SessionPage.tsx`). Creating a room (`src/helpers/link.ts`) just
generates a UUID and navigates to `/<uuid>` — no registration step.

`src/index.tsx` is a small Bun `serve()` used for **local dev and `bun start`**;
it mirrors the same routing (`/` → index, `/*` → not-found). Full details in
[`build-and-deploy.md`](./build-and-deploy.md).

### 2. Realtime transport — `useAblyBackend`

`src/hooks/useAblyBackend.ts` owns the single Ably connection. It joins a channel
named after the room id and exposes two things:

- **Presence** → the participant roster. `enter`/`present`/`update`/`leave`
  presence events map to `RegisterUser`/`UpdateUser`/`RemoveUser` machine
  actions.
- **Pub/sub messages** → voting events. Named messages
  (`START_SESSION`, `END_SESSION`, `VOTE`, `MODERATOR_SYNC`) map to machine
  events.

It also returns a `publish(event)` function that does the reverse: turn a machine
event into the right Ably presence update or channel message. A `DefaultUser`
(random UUID + a [`sillyname`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sillyname)) is
created per browser tab and used as the Ably `clientId`. See
[`realtime-sync.md`](./realtime-sync.md).

### 3. State machine — `src/lib/machines/voting`

An XState 5 machine with four states (`Idle`, `Pool`, `PoolVote`, `PoolResult`)
and a context of `{ users, roomId, votes }`. Events drive transitions; actions
mutate context (record a vote, add/remove a user, clear the pool); guards gate
moderator-only transitions. This is the **entire behavioral contract** of a room.
Full reference in [`state-machine.md`](./state-machine.md).

### 4. Domain bridge — `CoreClient`

`src/lib/core.ts` is the heart of the client. It:

- **Owns the actor.** Creates and starts the XState actor for the room.
- **Exposes intents.** `vote()`, `startSession()`, `endSession()` are surfaced
  on the computed state object for the UI to call.
- **Computes view state.** `#computeState()` flattens machine state + the current
  user's role into a single discriminated union (`CoreClientState`) that the UI
  can `switch` on. The shape changes by role: a moderator's `Pool` state carries
  `endSession`, a regular user's does not.
- **Bridges the network both ways.** Outgoing: `#publishEvent` sends an event to
  the **local** actor *and* calls `tapUserEvents` (wired to Ably `publish`).
  Incoming: `backendCallback`/`register`/`update`/`remove` feed
  network-originated events into the local actor.
- **Drives moderator sync.** When a new user registers and the local user is the
  moderator, it emits a `ModeratorSync` aimed at that newcomer so they can catch
  up to an in-progress session (see [`realtime-sync.md`](./realtime-sync.md)).

### 5. React integration — hooks

- `src/hooks/useCoreClientState.ts` constructs the `CoreClient`, wires the Ably
  backend's callbacks into it, subscribes React state to machine snapshots, and
  sets `client.tapUserEvents = publish`. This is the seam where the domain layer,
  the transport, and React meet.
- `src/hooks/useRoom.tsx` wraps the above in a React context (`RoomProvider` /
  `useRoom`) and exposes `{ state, roomId, updateUser }` to the component tree.

### 6. UI layer

`src/Session/SessionPage.tsx` composes the providers and picks a view per state:

```
BasePage
└─ RoomProvider                     (state + intents via context)
   └─ AvatarProvider                (profile editor + nudges)
      └─ PageContent
         ├─ ModeratorModal          (shown when no moderator present)
         ├─ RoomDetails             (timer · moderator controls · roster · invite)
         └─ SwitchViews
            ├─ Idle   → States/Idle.tsx     ("waiting to start")
            ├─ Pool   → States/Pool.tsx     (the card grid)
            └─ Result → States/Result.tsx   (tallied results)
```

Cards and avatar nudges are driven by **RxJS observables**
(`src/observables/*`). Details in [`ui-layer.md`](./ui-layer.md).

### 7. Cross-cutting concerns

- **Theme** (`src/theme.ts`): a dark MUI theme with custom button variants and
  the Mont typeface.
- **Analytics** (`src/helpers/analytics.ts`, `AnalyticsProvider`): PostHog +
  OpenReplay, gated behind a cookie-consent banner and disabled in development
  (calls are routed through a debug proxy instead).
- **Constants** (`src/constants.ts`): environment detection (`isDev`), base URL,
  and the public Ably / Giphy keys.

## End-to-end data flow: casting a vote

This is the canonical path; start/stop/register follow the same shape.

```
 ① User clicks a card in States/Pool.tsx
       │  onClick={() => vote(value)}
       ▼
 ② CoreClient.#voteAction  (src/lib/core.ts)
       │  records vote on local user, then #publishEvent(Vote)
       ▼
 ③ #publishEvent does TWO things:
       ├─▶ this.#actor.send(Vote)        ← optimistic local update
       └─▶ this.tapUserEvents(Vote)      ← hand off to the network
                                  │
                                  ▼
 ④ useCoreClientState: tapUserEvents = publish
       │  publish(Vote)  (src/hooks/useAblyBackend.ts)
       ▼
 ⑤ Ably channel.publish("VOTE", { vote, createdBy, ... })
                                  │
            ┌─────────────────────┴───────────────────────┐
            ▼                                             ▼
   (this browser, echo)                          (every other browser)
            │                                             │
            ▼                                             ▼
 ⑥ channel.subscribe callback → poolEventCallback(Vote)
       │                                                  │
       ▼                                                  ▼
 ⑦ CoreClient.backendCallback(Vote)
       │  validates sender is a known user & state allows it
       │  this.#actor.send(Vote)
       ▼
 ⑧ Machine runs computeVote action → context.votes[userId] = vote
       │
       ▼
 ⑨ actor subscription fires → #computeState → setState (React)
       │
       ▼
 ⑩ States/Pool.tsx re-renders; the chosen card shows as selected,
    and the user's avatar badge updates in SessionVotesSummary
```

Two things worth noting:

- **Optimistic + echo.** The originating client applies the vote locally in step
  ③ *and* re-applies the echoed message in step ⑦. Votes are idempotent
  (writing the same `votes[userId] = value` twice is harmless), so the echo
  doesn't cause drift.
- **Guarding at the edge.** `backendCallback` ignores events from unknown senders
  and events that don't make sense in the current state, so a stray message
  can't corrupt the machine.

## Where state actually lives

| State | Owner | Synced via |
|---|---|---|
| Participant roster (`users`) | each machine's `context.users` | Ably **presence** |
| Voting phase (`Idle`/`Pool`/…) | each machine's state value | Ably **pub/sub** (`START_/END_SESSION`) + moderator sync |
| Votes (`votes`) | each machine's `context.votes` | Ably **pub/sub** (`VOTE`) + moderator sync |
| Current user identity | `DefaultUser` in `useAblyBackend` | local; published into presence |
| Profile edits (name/emoji/avatar) | machine `context.users` | Ably **presence** `update` |
| Consent / analytics identity | cookies + PostHog | local + PostHog |

## Key invariants

- **Exactly one moderator.** `registerUserActionAssign` demotes any second user
  who claims `moderator: true` when a moderator already exists. When the room has
  no moderator (`moderatorEmpty`), `ModeratorModal` is shown so someone can claim
  the seat.
- **The machine starts at `Idle`.** A late joiner therefore begins in `Idle` even
  if a session is already running — the moderator-sync protocol exists precisely
  to fast-forward them. See [`realtime-sync.md`](./realtime-sync.md).
- **`votes` is keyed by user id** and cleared (`clearPoolActionAssign`) whenever a
  new pool starts.
